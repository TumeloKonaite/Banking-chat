  "question": "What are the monthly service fees for the everyday current account?",
  "reference_answer": "The everyday current account charges a single monthly service fee that covers standard transactions and digital banking access.",
  "generated_answer": "The documents do not specify the monthly service fees for the everyday current account. From the documents: there is no mention of specific fees associated with this account type.",
  "keywords": [
    "monthly service fee",
    "current account"
  ],
  "feedback": "The answer correctly states that the documents do not specify the monthly service fees, which is accurate compared to the question. However, it fails to acknowledge the information in the reference answer indicating a single monthly fee for standard transactions and digital banking. This makes it incomplete. The answer is relevant to the question but misses key details from the reference. It would be more accurate and complete if it acknowledged the existence of a fee as specified in the reference.",
